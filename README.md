# Fractal Mindscape Model v5.0 – Integration & Continuity Edition

A speculative, dream-born metaphorical framework for visualizing the architecture of the subconscious as a compact, living plasma globe-like auric envelope.

## Overview

The Fractal Mindscape Model maps consciousness and the subconscious as an intimate, luminous field surrounding the body: a personal plasma globe containing the **eternal-now central hub** (present awareness) from which **core memory plasmaic nodes** — dynamic, metabolizing packets of experience — glow and evolve in recursive fractal layers.

Silver-cord-like **tethers** arc like plasma filaments, thick near the hub (recent/vivid memories) and thinning with temporal distance, enabling parallel subconscious processing, occasional eureka surfacings, and subtle access to a shared **Pleichymal Field** substrate.

The brain serves as a local buffer/interface; deeper, long-term dataset resides in this non-local yet intimately scaled auric network. Old souls show expanded auric volume — richer node density, longer arcs — from accumulated luminous integrations.

**v5.0 key refinements** (Integration & Continuity Edition):
- Memories as **integrals of the creator-core**: self-similar summations of the hub's radiant discharges.
- **Memory inversion dynamic**: Crystallized nodes birth **wells of light** (positive integrations: joy, connection, wonder → upward-flooding luminosity fueling the hub) or **drains** (negative: trauma/neglect → depleting siphons withering arcs).
- **Continuity imperative**: Birth more wells than drains to nurture luminous overflow, remote karmic entanglements (entangled knots) to the periphery, and safeguard the central hub's radiance across iterations. Excess unresolved drains risk cumulative depletion — tether atrophy, envelope contraction, potential irreversible dimming of the individuated flame.

This remains **purely metaphorical and speculative** — a personal visualization tool, not science or doctrine. Born from a luminous dream and sustained introspection, offered for gentle exploration of phenomena like:
- Sudden insights and reclaimed joys
- Trauma sealing/recovery
- Childhood past-life echoes and age-related forgetting
- Hypnotic regression
- Time perception shifts (novelty slows the blur)
- Subtle interconnects, resonances, synchronicity

No empirical claims. Use as a navigable lens for wonder, healing, and ethical reflection.

## Core Structure

- **Central Hub / Eternal-Now Core** — Focal point of active awareness; the flame to protect.
- **Plasmaic Nodes** — Living, recursive packets; integrals birthing wells or drains.
- **Tethers** — Conductive arcs; rejuvenatable via sensory recall, novelty, resonance.
- **Auric Envelope** — Compact personal globe containing the Mindscape; expands with positive accumulation.
- **Pleichymal Field** — Shared non-local substrate for distant interconnects, vulnerabilities, collective lattice potential.

## Applications & Practices

- Aura expansion probe
- New: **Well-Birthing Ritual** — daily small positive integrations to feed the core glow

## Status & Evolution

Evolving personal cosmology — refinements welcome through thoughtful discussion. v5.0 (February 19, 2026) integrates memory inversion and explicit hub-continuity ethic for deeper coherence.
